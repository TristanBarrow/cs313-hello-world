After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:

Heroku is currently unavaliable. My old site is still hosted but I cannot push to heroku for some reason on their end.

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/TristanBarrow/cs313-home-page/tree/master/web/shopping-cart

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

Currently the only thing that works is adding things to the cart on the client side. I will soon sent that data up to the server
and update the server using the client data. Once that is done, I will display that data on the cart page. It will also add up 
the price of the items.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

Most of it. I will re-submit a file after working on it for a bit more time.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I learned about global varibles and session varibles which helped a ton.

6. List one strength and one limitation of using cookies.

Strength: cookies let you easily identify a returning user.
Limitation: cookies can be removed by the client.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

D - I feel like I amd in category D.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I am in category D because I went beyond requirements but I also was late quite a bit on my assignment.
I should focus first on my assignment then on helping others next time.
